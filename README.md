# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption

## 📘 Overview
This project implements the **Caesar Cipher algorithm**, one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques.  
It allows users to **encrypt** and **decrypt** text messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a user-defined number of positions.

---

## 🧠 Features
- Encrypt and decrypt any text message  
- User-defined shift value for custom encryption  
- Preserves spaces, numbers, and special characters  
- Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User enters a message and a shift value.  
2. The program shifts each alphabetic character by the shift amount.  
3. Decryption is done by reversing the shift.
